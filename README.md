# DBMS-Movie-Ticket-Booking-System
A comprehensive Python-based application designed to streamline the process of booking movie tickets through a user-friendly interface and robust backend database management. The system is divided into two main components: the frontend, which provides an interactive graphical user interface for users, and the backend, which handles all database operations, business logic, and data integrity.

The frontend allows users to browse available movies, view showtimes, select seats, and book tickets with ease. It is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that even users with minimal technical knowledge can navigate the system efficiently. The interface typically includes features such as movie listings, showtime selection, seat availability visualization, and booking confirmation. Users can also manage their bookings, view past reservations, and cancel tickets if needed.

On the backend, the system utilizes a relational database (such as SQLite) to store and manage all relevant data, including movie details, showtimes, seat layouts, user information, and booking records. The backend ensures data consistency and security, handling concurrent booking requests and preventing double-booking of seats. It also provides administrative functionalities, allowing authorized personnel to add new movies, update showtimes, and manage user accounts.

The project demonstrates key concepts in database management systems, such as entity-relationship modeling, normalization, and transaction management. It also showcases practical skills in Python programming, GUI development (using libraries like Tkinter), and database connectivity. The inclusion of ER diagrams and schema documentation further aids in understanding the system's architecture and data flow.

Overall, this Movie Ticket Booking System serves as an excellent educational tool for students and developers interested in learning about database-driven application development, user interface design, and the integration of frontend and backend technologies. It can be extended with additional features such as online payment integration, user authentication, and reporting tools, making it a versatile foundation for real-world ticketing solutions.
